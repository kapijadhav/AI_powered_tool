AI-Powered Code Analyzer Tool for Performance Bottlenecks
# AI-Powered Code Analyzer

## Project Overview

This is an AI-powered web tool built using Flask that analyzes Python code snippets to identify potential performance bottlenecks. It suggests optimizations such as reducing inefficiencies in loops, avoiding infinite loops, and more.

## Features

- Identify inefficient use of `len()` in loops.
- Detect infinite loops (`while True`).
- Provide suggestions for optimizing code performance.

## How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Flask
- Pygments (for syntax highlighting)
- Virtual Environment (recommended)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
